Let's go

First, add your wheat and sugar to the mug. Mix it well.
Then, break your egg into the cup and use the fold method to spread it all around.
Add your milk and oil to the mix and keep stirring. Ensure that the sugar has dissolved.
Pre-mash your banana and add about one tablespoon to the mixture.
Add the essence and the baking powder, and give the mixture one last whirl.

Plop it in the microwave for 1 - 1.30 minutes. 

Boom! That's not your cake exploding, but the sound of delight once you get to taste your quick and easy cake! Enjoy!
